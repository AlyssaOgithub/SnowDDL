SnowDDL is an advanced tool for object management automation in [Snowflake](http://snowflake.com).

It is not intended to replace other tools entirely, but to provide an alternative approach focused on practical data engineering challenges.

You may find SnowDDL useful if:

- business requirements and complexity of data schema grows exponentially;
- your organization has multiple accounts for different environments (dev, stage, prod);
- your organization has multiple developers sharing the same Snowflake account;
- you want to generate some objects dynamically using Python ([Data Vault](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_vault_modeling), [Star Schema](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_schema), etc.)
